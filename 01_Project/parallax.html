        Thanks to Professor!</h1>
      <p id="thanks">
        Dear Professor Hawking, I wanted to express my deepest gratitude for
        your extraordinary contributions to the field of physics. Your
        groundbreaking work on black holes and cosmology has not only expanded
        our understanding of the universe but has also inspired countless
        individuals, including myself, to pursue a passion for science. Your
        theories, particularly on Hawking radiation and the nature of
        singularities, have challenged and enriched our perception of space and
        time. Beyond your scientific achievements, your ability to communicate
        complex ideas with clarity and enthusiasm has made the wonders of the
        cosmos accessible to people of all backgrounds. Your books, especially
        "A Brief History of Time," have ignited a spark of curiosity in many,
        encouraging us to explore the mysteries of the universe. Your
        perseverance in the face of immense personal challenges is a testament
        to the power of human spirit and intellect. You have shown us that with
        determination and a sense of wonder, we can overcome obstacles and reach
        for the stars. Thank you, Professor Hawking, for your invaluable
        contributions to science and for inspiring generations to look beyond
        the horizon and dream of what lies beyond.
